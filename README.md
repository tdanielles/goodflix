## Dataset
The dataset is from MovieLens' 25M Dataset: [Link](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/)
- The dataset files used were movies.csv and ratings.csv (they were too large to be uploaded to Github)

## What I learned
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Using the pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn libraries
- Implementing collaborative filtering
- Python pickling with pickle
